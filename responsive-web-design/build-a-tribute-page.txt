      <ul id="tribute-info">
        <li id="Ash">Ash still has some of his childish excitement, but he also demonstrated much greater maturity and level-headiness since entering the Kalos region, both in battles and out.</li>
        <li id="Ash">Also, Ash is completely opened to advice from others. Through his journey, Ash realized his impatience needed fixing, especially for battles, due to it not only causing him to lose a Gym Battle but was also affecting his bond with one of his Pokémon, although his fear of losing his Pokémon family also did him in.</li>
        <li id="Ash">Through his maturity, Ash hardly loses his temper and even keep his cool more, which is shown when he would lose a battle, as he doesn't hardly get worked up then he used to in the past.</li>
        <li id="pokemon">
          <a>Pikachu</a><br>
          Ash got Pikachu from Professor Oak way back in the Kanto region where they started their journey together. It was Ash's first ever pokemon and although they did not quite hit it off at the start they have now come a long way.
        </li>
        <li id="pokemon">
          <a>Greninja</a><br>
          Greninja was the first Pokémon Ash obtained in the Kalos region. Ash met Greninja when he used to be a Froakie, where Froakie saw something special in him and decided to let him be his Trainer. Ash trained Greninja to his full potential, which led him to evolve into his first stage, Frogadier. After evolving into his final stage of evolution, Ash and Greninja gained a special power through their bond, which is known as the "Bond Phenomenon" as it rivals the power of Mega Evolution.
        </li>
        <li id="pokemon">
          <a>Talonflame</a><br>
          Talonflame was the second Pokémon Ash caught in the Kalos region. Ash has known Talonflame since it was a Fletchling. They have a very good relationship with each other as Ash used Talonflame a lot in his Gym Battles. After evolving into Fletchinder and Talonflame, Ash was proud of its growth. When Talonflame was in danger, Ash risked his own life to protect it. Ash left Talonflame with Professor Oak when his Kalos journey ended but knows he'll see it again whenever he comes to visit. Also, Ash have Talonflame help him sometimes.
        </li>
        <li id="pokemon">
          <a>Hawlucha</a><br>
          When Ash first meet Hawlucha, he was impressed with his way of battling. Seeing him struggle with one of his moves, Ash offered to help Hawlucha and they train to perfect it, which worked. After helping him, Ash offered Hawlucha a spot on his team, to which Hawlucha accepted, thus becoming the third Pokémon he caught in Kalos. Ash and Hawlucha are very close with each other. After his Kalos journey concluded, Ash left Hawlucha with Professor Oak but knows he'll be waiting for his return when he visits Pallet Town. Also, Ash called upon Hawlucha from time to time.
        </li>
        <li id="pokemon">
          <a>Goodra</a><br>
          Goodra was the fourth Pokémon Ash caught in the Kalos region. Ash has known Goodra since it was a Goomy. Upon hearing its status as the weakest of all Dragon-type Pokémon, Ash wasn't sure to call it that type of Pokémon but realize that it wasn't weak at all, after it saved him and two of his Pokémon from Team Rocket. Seeing that Goodra wanted to become stronger like him and Pikachu, Ash offered Goomy a spot on his team and they formed a close relationship with each other. After evolving into Sliggoo and Goodra, Ash succeeded in making it stronger. When they return to Goodra's home, Ash told it to stay at its home so it can protect it from the danger of other invading Pokémon. Ash ended up visiting it later on and asked Goodra to join him in the Kalos League. After the League was over, Ash bid Goodra farewell and promised to always be friends till the end.
        </li>
        <li id="pokemon">
          <a>Noivern</a><br>
          Ash has parent and child relationship with Noivern as Hawlucha found him when he was an Egg. After hatching into a Noibat and had trouble flying, Ash offered to help with its learning. Ash then suggested in having it join him and his team, to which Noibat accepted as he didn't want to leave Ash. When Noivern, (during its time as a Noibat), wanted to prove himself, Ash understood and didn't get in the way of his choice. After evolving, Ash was very proud of Noivern and was happy how strong he became. Ash left Noivern with Professor Oak once his journey through Kalos ended but knows he'll reunite with it whenever he comes home for a visit. Also, Ash has called on Noivern for help sometimes.
